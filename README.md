# Auto Insurance Project
### Claims prediction
  The prediction of claims or accidents is omnipresent among insurance companies, banks, and almost everything
A good example: America, where predicting future accidents means Net Profit for companies like "Allstate" and "Nationwide"
In this context, the CGA affirms: "the development potential of insurance in Tunisia remains weakly exploited"
And one of the recommendations: "The CGA must review the current pricing system and, restore tariffs based on technical data and prohibit the forced sale of additional guarantees."

The objective of this study is to predict the probability of the involvement of a future accident 

We tried to combine 4 factors:

* insurer information
* vehicle information
* police information
* past accidents experience

These 4 factors reveal the parttern of the disaster profile in real life and the insurance can take it into account to better personalize the contribution, and on all that can reduce the frequency of horrible loss in Tunisia.

### Fraud detection

Fraud detection: Created a proof of concept to expedite the personal auto claims process with computer vision and deep learning.Identified damage location and severity to accuracies of 79% and 71% respectively. Trained a pipeline of convolutional neuralnetworks using transfer learning on VGG16 with Keras and Theano to classify damage.
